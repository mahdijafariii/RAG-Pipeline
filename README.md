# üîç RAG Pipeline Project

This is a full-stack **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system, combining powerful context-aware language generation with efficient information retrieval.

## üß† What is this project?

This project implements a **modular RAG architecture** consisting of:

- **Backend (FastAPI)**: Handles document retrieval, context building, and LLM-based response generation using various providers like HuggingFace, Gemini, Ollama, and Together.
- **Frontend (React Chatbot)**: A simple and interactive chat UI allowing users to query and receive intelligent responses from the RAG system.
